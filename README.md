# DictatorLike

## What's this?

DictatorLike is a project attempting to recreate, in Python, an old and kinda obscure videogame, [Dictator](https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/software/games/dictator-dktronics-ltd), which was published in the 80s by DKTronics for computers such as Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum.

You can play an original C64 version [here](https://c64online.com/c64-games/dictator/).

## How to play?

As now, DictatorLike is meant to be played from terminal, so giving your input as "yes" or "no"s and receveing feedback with text and ascii "art". The next step will be adding a GUI.
